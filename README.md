This is the Sermon UI for my Elevation Church Interview.

This is for Step 3 of the ask.

3.) Create ANOTHER LARAVEL application that will list the sermon records in an HTML table (pagination would be great) using the endpoint from the API application. (Consuming the API endpoint).

This UI depends on the connection with the sermon-api.
Because of this, Make sure to update the Environment variable called API_URL to the correct location of the environment.
